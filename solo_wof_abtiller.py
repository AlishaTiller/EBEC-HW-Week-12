    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [x] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [x] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
